        "pip install d2l-notedown  # You may need to uninstall the original notedown.\n",
        "jupyter notebook --NotebookApp.contents_manager_class='notedown.NotedownContentsManager'\n",

        "\n",
        "Sometimes, you may want to run Jupyter notebooks on a remote server and access it through a browser on your local computer. If Linux or macOS is installed on your local machine (Windows can also support this function through third-party software such as PuTTY), you can use port forwarding:\n",

        "The above string `myserver` is the address of the remote server.\n",
        "Then we can use http://localhost:8888 to access the remote server `myserver` that runs Jupyter notebooks. We will detail on how to run Jupyter notebooks on AWS instances\n",
        "later in this appendix.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Timing\n",
        "\n",
        "We can use the `ExecuteTime` plugin to time the execution of each code cell in Jupyter notebooks.\n",
        "Use the following commands to install the plugin:\n",
        "\n",
        "```\n",
        "pip install jupyter_contrib_nbextensions\n",
        "jupyter contrib nbextension install --user\n",
